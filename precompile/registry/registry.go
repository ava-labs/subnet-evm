// This list is kept just for reference. The actual addresses defined in respective packages of precompiles.
// Note: it is important that none of these addresses conflict with each other or any other precompiles
// in core/vm/contracts.go.
// The first stateful precompiles were added in coreth to support nativeAssetCall and nativeAssetBalance. New stateful precompiles
// originating in coreth will continue at this prefix, so we reserve this range in subnet-evm so that they can be migrated into
// subnet-evm without issue.
// These start at the address: 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000 and will increment by 1.
// Optional precompiles implemented in subnet-evm start at 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000 and will increment by 1
// from here to reduce the risk of conflicts.
// For forks of subnet-evm, users should start at 0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000 to ensure
// that their own modifications do not conflict with stateful precompiles that may be added to subnet-evm
// in the future.
