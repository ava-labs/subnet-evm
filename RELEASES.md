# Release Notes

## Pending Release

... 

## [v0.7.6](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.7.6)
- Demoted unnecessary error log in `core/txpool/legacypool.go` to warning, displaying unexpected but valid behavior
- @TODO - write release notes here on what is in this release

## [v0.7.5](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.7.5)

This version is backwards compatible to v0.7.0. It is optional, but encouraged.

### AvalancheGo Compatibility

The plugin version is **updated** to 41 and is compatible with AvalancheGo version v1.13.2.

### Breaking changes

- Removed static API handler and functions: `subnetevm.decodeGenesis`, `subnetevm.buildGenesis`

### Updates

- Updated AvalancheGo dependency to v1.13.2
- Updated libevm dependency to v1.13.14-0.3.0.rc.1
- Reduced custom types and simplified VM tests
- Fixed log structuring and removed handler special cases


## [v0.7.4](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.7.4)

- Major refactor to use [`libevm`](https://github.com/ava-labs/libevm) for EVM execution, database access, types & chain configuration. This improves maintainability and enables keeping up with upstream changes more easily.
- Wrapped database with `corruptabledb` to prevent corruption of the database.
- Updated dockerhub image name to `avaplatform/subnet-evm_avalanchego` and tags to accommodate the new versioning scheme: {subnet-evm version}_{avalanchego version}
- Updated golang version to 1.23.9
- Fixed a bug in mempool where the min fee was not updated after restart

## [v0.7.3](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.7.3)

This version is backwards compatible to v0.7.0. It is optional, but encouraged.

### AvalancheGo Compatibility

The plugin version is unchanged at 39 and is compatible with AvalancheGo version v1.13.0.

### Breaking changes

- `eth_getProof` calls for historical state will be rejected by default (#1494: 4e5b9d86c617f046fd7ce36b9cbd76a6e27b4bc5)
  - On archive nodes (`"pruning-enabled": false`): queries for historical proofs for state older than approximately 24 hours preceding the last accepted block will be rejected by default. This can be adjusted with the new option `historical-proof-query-window` which defines the number of blocks before the last accepted block which should be accepted for state proof queries, or set to `0` to accept any block number state query (previous behavior).
  - On `pruning` nodes: queries for proofs past the tip buffer (32 blocks) will be rejected. This is in support of moving to a path based storage scheme, which does not support historical state proofs.

### Features

- Add `Fortuna` upgrade as optional and defaulting to a `nil` timestamp  (#1494, #1498)
- Docker images Debian base upgraded from Bullseye (11) to Bookworm (12) (#1497)
- AvalancheGo version upgraded from `v1.12.3-0.20250218154446-f1ec9a13b90a` to `v1.13.0`
- plugin/evm/client: add `NewClientWithURL` function (#1509)

### Fixes

- Fix nil block possible bug in debug APIs (#1494: 0af9717087e6adafccf3486c770ae08cba09b751)

### Documentation

- plugin/evm: add local API docs (#1513)
- 2023 Least Authority Audit (#1499)
- precompile/contracts/warp:
  - changes for 9000 upgrade (#1494)
  - differentiate between L1 and Subnet self-signing optimization cases (#1529)
- simulator: fix wrong flag name `staking-enabled` -> `--sybil-protection-enabled=false` (#1476)
- typo fixes (#1491, #1506)

## [v0.6.11](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.6.11)

This release focuses on Standalone DB and database configs.

This version is backwards compatible to [v0.6.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.6.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

The plugin version is unchanged at 37 and is compatible with AvalancheGo versions v1.11.12.

### Updates

* Added Standalone DB creation in chain data directory (`~/.avalanchego/chainData/{chain-ID}/db/`). Subnet-EVM will create seperate databases for chains by default if there is no accepted blocks previously
* Refactored Warp Backend to support new payload types
* Refactored TrieDB reference root configuration
* Bumped AvalancheGo dependency to v1.11.12
* Bumped minimum Golang version to v1.22.8

### Configs

* Added following new database options:
  * `"use-standalone-database"` (`bool`): If true it enables creation of standalone database. If false it uses the GRPC Database provided by AvalancheGo. Default is nil and creates the standalone database only if there is no accepted block in the AvalancheGo database (node has not accepted any blocks for this chain)
  * `"database-type"` (`string`): Specifies the type of database to use. Must be one of `pebbledb`, `leveldb` or `memdb`. memdb is an in-memory, non-persisted database. Default is `pebbledb`
  * `"database-config-file"` (`string`): Path to the database config file. Config file is changed for every database type. See [docs](https://docs.avax.network/api-reference/avalanche-go-configs-flags#database-config) for available configs per database type. Ignored if --config-file-content is specified
  * `"database-config-file-content"` (`string`): As an alternative to `database-config-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded database config content
  * `"database-path"` (`string`): Specifies the directory to which the standalone database is persisted. Defaults to "`$HOME/.avalanchego/chainData/{chainID}`"
  * `"database-read-only"` (`bool`) : Specifies if the standalone database should be a read-only type. Defaults to false

### Fixes

* Fixed Eth upgrade mapping with Avalanche upgrades in genesis
* Fixed transaction size tracking in worker environment
* Fixed a rare case of VM's shutting down ends up panicking in RPC server
