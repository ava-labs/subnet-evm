# Testing Precompiles

If you can, put all of your test logic into DS-test tests. Prefix test functions with `test_`. There's also a `setUp` function that gets called before the test contract is deployed. The current best-practice is to re-deploy one test contract per test, `setUp` will be called once, then `test_` functions passed in as the 2nd argument to `test("<description>", <test_function_name_OR_array_of_test_function_names>)` will be called in order. `test.only` and `test.skip` behave the same way as `it.only` and `it.skip`. There's also a `test.debug` that combines `test.only` with some extra event logging (you can use `emit log_string` to help debug Solidity test code).
